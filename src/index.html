                Hello, My name is Shayne and I am a computer programming <i>Enthusiast</i>. I enjoy playing with, programming, designing, and working on 
                <b>Computers</b>, their <b>Software</b>, and their <b>Hardware</b>. I began my investigations in my early childhood. Though these early
                endevers were mostly fruitless; suddenly an excitement, passion, and intrest was born. I am now Syudying <b>Computer Science</b> at the
                Rochester Institute of Technology. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My noodlings mostly involve <b>Algorithm</b> visualization, simple <b>Games</b>, and other small programs. I am also designing a personalized
                CPU architecture, assembly language, compilers, and tooling to create my own computer and software package. This website is a work in progress,
                so check back for more projects, information, and updates. In the meantime; here are some links!
